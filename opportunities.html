    <ul>
      <li class="pb-4">
        <b>Military: </b>Sonar has been a part of military naval activities since its introduction due to its high suitability for an aquatic environment. 
        Due to its versatility, sonar technology can be used for a variety of purposes, including navigation, surveillance, and security. Sonar technology fulfills its 
        role the best of any other possible technology and is very important to present naval activities.
      </li>
      <li class="pb-4">
        <b>Scientific: </b>Sonar has a wide range of uses in the science industry. It’s integral to detecting bodies/entities within the water, allowing scientists to detect clusters of marine life, or to map out ocean floors.
        Its characteristics of being able to differentiate object densities or acoustic factors allows scientists to make better educated guesses on what is being read (i.e. fish size, or sea floor material). 
        Scientists can then use this data to track changes in marine life’s location, population, or general behaviour. Making use of bottom-up sonar also allows scientists to measure factors of the water, such as wave height, or water velocity. Not only is sonar being utilised on our own earth’s waters, there are also proposals for its use on other planets.
      </li>
      <li class="pb-5">
      <b>Civilian/Industry</b>The most notable usage of sonar in a civilian context is for the fishery industry, which allows these parties to find and harvest fish. Fishermen can not only detect fish with this technology, but also the environment of the ocean floor allowing them to determine factors such as water depth, or seabed ecology. 
      They are also able to track their nets using similar technology. Sonar has become a staple in the fishing industry and has been a significant driving force behind the industries’ development.
      Modern commercial fishing vessels almost exclusively make use of sonar tech to find fish. The fishing industry would most certainly not be where it is today if not for sonar tech. Small sonar sensors are also utilised on autonomous/remote underwater vehicles in situations where cameras may not suffice for navigation (i.e. murky waters).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h3 class="pb-3">Further Opportunities</h3>
      <li>
        As Sonar is ideal for deep sea navigation as at such low depths, virtually no natural light reaches that deep. 
        Virtually every AUV and ROV developed for deep-water exploration have been equipped with sonar capabilities. The deep-sea Urashima vessel utilises sonar for its autonomous operation. 
        The side scan sonar can map the geometry and texture of the seafloor below it. Its inertial navigation system relies on ground speed readings measured by the vessel’s Doppler sonar. 
        The full range of equipment also includes Acoustic Homing Sonar, Obstacle Avoidance Sonar, and a Chirp Sonar(Hamblinf, D. 2021). Therefore a conclusion was made that Sonar technology can likely provide us with the opportunity for deep-ocean navigation and discovery, though this may also come with the consequence of having a negative impact on any undiscovered species that make use of sonar in their deep water environment.
        The technology will have to be used with caution as to not disturb the marine ecosystem any further. While it may allow us the possibility for underwater expeditions in untraversed areas, it also runs the risk of introducing measurement bias into the environment being studied, as well as the chance of leaving lasting effects in the area’s ecosystem.
