    <h3>Environmental risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Marine mammals are affected negatively by sonar as it changes their dive profiles, causes bubble formation or decompression sickness, and sonar transmitters can kill them. 
        Marine animals can be killed by sonar transmitters with high power, as most of the transmitters operate at frequencies of 3 to 7 kHz, which have killed seven whales in the past. 
        The effects of these deaths can also include lung hemorrhage, tissue trauma, temporary or permanent hearing loss, or impairment among others. 
        When it has been used, it creates a loud noise under the water, and this can negatively affect cetaceans' hearing. Another negative disadvantage of sonar 
        technology is that the data that the system has collected cannot be transferred by that technology. (Curious, 2019)

    <h3>Mental and health risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As a result of an accident, a scuba diver was accidentally exposed to sonar from a US navy LFA system on August 25th, 1994. 
        As a result, the diver experienced distinct and disorienting lung vibrations. An additional diver who was exposed to sonar had to be 
        hospitalized and was being treated for seizures. Despite exposure to around 240dB to 120dB, humans and animals can still be affected. 
        The US navy has stated that concussions are unlikely to occur at levels between 194 decibels, but there is no evidence to support this claim. 
        Till this day, they have not found any solutions. (Ocean Mammal Institute)
