        Active sonars use a range of frequencies depending upon the role of the equipment. Lower frequencies (below 20 kHz) have potentially greater ranges in seawater due to lower rates of sound attenuation with distance. 
        Detection of distant objects therefore relies on the use of lower frequencies, the lower the better, however, lower frequencies are not suitable for detection of small objects.
        High to very high frequencies (above 100 kHz) provide excellent resolution of objects such as fish, small objects, and the sea floor but suffer from severe attenuation with distance from the source. These systems are only practical in shallow water or for short range detection of objects near the source.
        To find a perfect solution for this technology is a bit of a problem as sonar is used using different sound levels. Those levels start at 240 dB and go down to 120 dB which is very harmful for both the human ears and the marine life who can hear at such frequencies that the sonar machines operate.
        There aren't any modifications we can make to the sonar technology to be more environment friendly as it needs to be loud at different frequencies for it to operate accurately and deliver precise information to the data collectors. (Kolev, 2011)

    <h3 class="py-3">Our own solution</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>There is only one possible solution for this problem and it is to create a new technology that would be able to scan for underwater hazards and marine life without harming the environment. Sonar technology is not modifiable therefore there is no simple solution that would reduce the effect of sonar waves and inventing a new piece of technology would be the best option to preserve the environment.
