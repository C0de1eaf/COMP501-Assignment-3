      <li>The overall topic of Sonar system has taught me not only that it has the ability to be used underwater, but it can also be used in other ways, 
        such as to detect mines, and it is an extremely useful tool that has been used by fishermen. From an ethical standpoint, it is hard to agree or 
        disagree with Sonar, since there have not been that many cases involving the system itself. Sonar systems have many pros for not only scientists 
        but also fishermen who use it daily in their lives since it helps them catch fish every day and increase the value of their stock when selling. 
        The cons are that as the vibration is extremely loud, it causes a lot of bleeding pain to ocean animals as it emits too much dBs during 
        it's other use, which is when it is used to detect objects on the sea floor, shipwrecks, etc. as well as causing hearing loss. The overall impression 
        I have on this topic is that I found it very interesting since I had no idea that not only it can affect animals, but it can also effect humans and the 
        economy in both positive and negative ways. It is difficult to find useful information on sonar system since it is not discussed much compared to solar system. 
        However, I learned a lot from learning about the different uses of Sonar system as I discovered how different companies use it and the number of DB's it emits, etc. 
        For example, companies such as the market group of France (Thales group), ATLAS ELEKTRONIK GmbH(Germany) etc.. still use sonar to this day. Looking at the scientific
         side of things, NOAA scientists still use sonar in order to develop nautical charts to investigate more creatures under the sea, explore the sea and expand the map 
         more as more sea floors could be hidden or created without them knowing. Not only that but I have learnt other uses of sonar, such as in mines. The issue of 
         ship noise has led to the use of towed sonar nowadays. Nevertheless, as a result of absorption and scattering phenomena in the underwater medium, the light 
         used to illuminate the target scene is affected. The visibility range is limited to a few meters, thus limiting the use of video cameras. As underwater images 
         have a weak contrast, edge detection methods are limited in their effectiveness due to the need for preprocessing. Sonar is widely used for detecting underwater 
         mines and in a number of other applications, despite all these drawbacks. </li>
