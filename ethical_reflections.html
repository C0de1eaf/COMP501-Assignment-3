      <li>The overall topic of Sonar system has taught me not only that it has the ability to be used underwater, but it can also be used in other ways, 
        such as to detect mines, and it is an extremely useful tool that has been used by fishermen. From an ethical standpoint, it is hard to agree or 
        disagree with Sonar, since there have not been that many cases involving the system itself. Sonar systems have many pros for not only scientists 
        but also fishermen who use it daily in their lives since it helps them catch fish every day and increase the value of their stock when selling. 
        The cons are that as the vibration is extremely loud, it causes a lot of bleeding pain to ocean animals as it emits too much dBs during 
        it's other use, which is when it is used to detect objects on the sea floor, shipwrecks, etc. as well as causing hearing loss. The overall impression 
        I have on this topic is that I found it very interesting since I had no idea that not only it can affect animals, but it can also effect humans and the 
        economy in both positive and negative ways. It is difficult to find useful information on sonar system since it is not discussed much compared to solar system. 
        </li>
        <li>
         However, I learned a lot from learning about the different uses of Sonar system as I discovered how different companies use it and the number of DB's it emits, etc. 
         For example, companies such as the market group of France (Thales group), ATLAS ELEKTRONIK GmbH(Germany) etc.. still use sonar to this day. Looking at the scientific
         side of things, NOAA scientists still use sonar in order to develop nautical charts to investigate more creatures under the sea, explore the sea and expand the map 
         more as more sea floors could be hidden or created without them knowing. Not only that but I have learnt other uses of sonar, such as in mines. The issue of 
         ship noise has led to the use of towed sonar nowadays. Nevertheless, as a result of absorption and scattering phenomena in the underwater medium, the light 
         used to illuminate the target scene is affected. The visibility range is limited to a few meters, thus limiting the use of video cameras. As underwater images 
         have a weak contrast, edge detection methods are limited in their effectiveness due to the need for preprocessing. Sonar is widely used for detecting underwater 
         mines and in a number of other applications, despite all these drawbacks.

        Fully learning in-depth about sonar technology has been a highly interesting experience as I've learnt many new things about this technology and topic. Understanding the deeper importance of sonar technology through its various industry uses has led me to further appreciate just how vital it is to our society's maritime activities.
        Checking more into the implications of sonar also led me to also realise how vital it is for marine life that we make use of sonar technology sparingly so we don't negatively impact marine life.
        Knowing that sonar technology is both vital to marine industries <i>and</i> detrimental to aquatic life within that same marine ecosystem has been an extremely compelling notion for me to think about.
        <br/>
        Yaroslav and Ina have also been ideal groupmates during this project - they were immensely collaborative, cooperative and helpful partners during this assignment and I believe they shared the same interest in this topic as I did.
        Overall, I still believe that sonar should still be used in our society despite its risks - many of the industries that make use of it would be made almost defunct if suddenly stripped of the capacity of sonar technology and as such, it is also extremely vital that they make use of sonar technology responsibly so that they don't ruin the same environment is critical to their field. Ultimately, I also believe that we should continue further research into the development of sonar technology, so that one day we may be able to use it freely without repercussion to the surrounding ecosystem.

    <h2>Yaroslav</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I learnt a lot about this topic and the impacts it holds on humans and the marine life. I did not know that the use of sonar has a negative impact on the marine life and how the sound waves stress out the marine mamals and cause them to panic and swim away from the sound due to its disturbing volume. What is the real cause of death for the marine animals? Due to the animal panicking it swims very quickly changing its swiming depth which may end in bubble formation (decompression sickness) which is gas escaping from lungs into the blood vessels. This increases chances of a stroke or a heart attack resulting in death. This of course causes several ethical issues such as protests to ban underwater travel/exploration due to sonar being actively used through out the travel possible causing harm to whales or dolphins from the sound waves. This would eventually cause problems for the fishermen as well as they are active sonar technology users and a ban on sonar would reduce the fishermens productivity by a lot.
      <br>
      As for the posittive aspects of the use of sonar, I learnt about how it protects the humans while traveling and exploring under water. Sonar provides humans with very accurately mapped data of incoming hazards/obstacles. This information is crucial for the human safety underwater because a lot of technology at great depths does not work properly due to high pressure and other factors. This positive aspect of sonar creates a good argument between why we should or shouldn't use this technology becuase meanwhile it provides safety for humans underwater it also affects the marine life and could critically damage it if it was to be overused.</li>
