      <b>What is Sonar System?</b>
      <ul>
          <p> </p>
          <li>Sonar system uses a certain type of transmitter known as "Piezoelectric Transducer. This transducer has the property of an electric power supply
              that creates a mixed sound of waves and vibration when it is activated. It is also used to naviagte and communicated with other ojects such as under the water
              or beneath the surface. Sonar itself is a type of technique that uses sound to nagivate what humans cannot see or get to. They do this by emitting sound and measure the 
              objects return when the object has been reflected. It is most common for sonar to be used under water as from the data it gets, it develops nautical charts and locates underwater hazards,
              search for maps and objects on the seafloor. 
          </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p> </p>
      <b>What are the types of Sonar?</b>
      <p>There are two types of Sonar that is commonly used. One being "passive" and the other, "active". </p>
      <ul>
          <li><b>Passive: </b>Sonars without transmission capability are known as passive sonar. For example, sumbarines are known to use it to detect noise that is generated by the machinery that is connect to them manually.
              When being echoed, the echo expands under the sea and by using that echo, it can determine the depth of the water and scan things under it. However, it cannot emmit any signals but instead it can 
              detect acoustic signals from their exeternal sources.
          </li>
          <p> </p>
          <li><b>Active: </b>The opposite of passive sonar is active sonar. Active sonar uses transmittion and receiving equiptment. Beside emitting the pulses of sound and listening for echoes, 
              the bot itself can also submerge into objects, measure water depth and bottom contour as well as it can also detect underwater obstacles to locate marine mammals, assist in navigation as well
              as search for ships. However, nowadays, active sonar is commonly used rather than passive because there is a variety of things in active sonar than passive.
          </li>
      </ul>

      <b> How can it be used for other things?</b>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Mine: </b>Not only sonar can be used to detect sounds from the bottom of the ocean, it can also be used in mines (detecting both normal and acoustic mines). </li>
      <p> </p>
      <li><b>Fishing: </b>It is quite common for fishermen to use sonar to find a school of fish, measure the depth and temperature of the ocean as if it's too cold or too hot, the fisherman 
          can detect whether the fish will be there or not. These readings can help them understand where to drop their nets as well as it can also detect and display distribution, density 
          and movement of any fish at any angle. When the sonar beam is above the fish, it curves downwards as the arched mark appears in the char display graphs and the distance changes 
          as information sends back to the fisherman.</li>
